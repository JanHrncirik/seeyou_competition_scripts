### How to use Total script (optional)

The script for Total results is optional. It is blank by default. In the absence of a Total script, results are simply added together to create a total score for each competitor.

If that doesn't solve your problem, you can use the Total script to calculate Total results in a different way. Procedure is the same way as for daily scripts except that they are located in Edit > Competition Properties > Total Script.
