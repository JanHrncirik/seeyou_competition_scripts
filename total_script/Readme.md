### How to use Total script (optional)

The script for Total results calculates score for each competitor from their daily scores. 

The script for Total results is optional. If no script is used, then results are simply added together to create a total score for each competitor.

If that doesn't solve your problem, you can use the Total script to calculate Total results in a different way. Procedure is the same way as for daily scripts except that they are located in Edit > Competition Properties > Total Script.
